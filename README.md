# Functional Programming Course

## Introduction
In the Middle Ages architects built great cathedrals using ad hoc practices. Often in the process of building them they collapsed and lots of people got hurt.  Sometime after the discovery of Calculus architects started building buildings using the laws of mathematics. And the buildings no longer collapsed.  Our work as imperative programmers is somewhat like these Middle Age architects.  It is ad hoc, and for the most part unprincipled, relying on skill and experience instead of science. Last century mathematicians discovered the calculus of Functions. The practice of functional programming is the art of building software using this calculus of functions.

In this course the implementation language will be Scala.  Haskell would be better if I knew it well. But hardly anyone can earn a living doing Haskell and Scala is good enough.  But if you are better at Javascript you could do the exercises in that language.  Golang, beyond a remedial level will not work because there are not polymorphic functions and the type system does not make it convenient to define Abstract Data Types except with an empty interface and runtime type checking.  Many of the exercises in this course come from a book called _Functional Programming In Scala_ by Runar Bjarnason and Paul Chiusano.
I could only get to the second chapter of my Functional Programming  in Scala book using Golang because of the two things I mentioned above.
I did not write that book I mean. Its written by Runar Bjarnason and Paul Chiusano (Edited) 
Rust might work too or untyped languages would probably work as well except I canâ€™t be as helpful to you.
